Ahh got it 👍 You meant **Data Structures**, not Data Science.
Here’s a **progressive list of Data Structures topics (Easy → Hard)**:

---

## **📚 Data Structures Roadmap (Easy → Hard)**

### **1. Basics (Fundamentals)**

* Introduction to Data Structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
* Memory management (stack vs heap)
* Complexity analysis: **Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega**
* Recursion basics

---

### **2. Linear Data Structures (Easy Level)**

* **Arrays**

  * Basics, operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
  * Multi-dimensional arrays
* **Strings**

  * Basic operations (reverse, substring, palindrome)
  * Pattern matching (Naïve, KMP, Rabin-Karp)
* **Linked Lists**

  * Singly, Doubly, Circular
  * Operations: insert, delete, reverse, detect cycle
* **Stacks**

  * Array/Linked list implementation
  * Applications: expression evaluation, parentheses matching
* **Queues**

  * Simple Queue
  * Circular Queue
  * Deque (Double-ended queue)
  * Priority Queue

---

### **3. Non-Linear Data Structures (Intermediate Level)**

* **Trees**

  * Binary Tree (traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order)
  * Binary Search Tree (BST)
  * Heap (Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Heapify, Heap Sort)
  * AVL Tree (rotations, balancing)
  * B-Tree, B+ Tree (used in databases)
* **Graphs**

  * Representation: adjacency matrix, adjacency list
  * Traversals: BFS, DFS
  * Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s, Kruskal’s)
  * Shortest Path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A\*)

---

### **4. Advanced Data Structures (Hard Level)**

* **Hashing**

  * Hash functions, collision handling (chaining, open addressing)
  * Applications: hash maps, sets
* **Tries (Prefix Trees)**

  * Insert/search/delete words
  * Autocomplete implementation
* **Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**

  * Range sum queries
  * Range minimum queries
* **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**

  * Path compression
  * Union by rank
* **Graph Algorithms (Advanced)**

  * Topological Sort
  * Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju, Tarjan)
  * Network Flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)

---

### **5. Expert / Specialized (Hardest Level)**

* Suffix Trees & Suffix Arrays (string matching, bioinformatics)
* KMP Automaton & Aho-Corasick Algorithm
* Red-Black Trees, Splay Trees, Treaps
* Skip Lists
* K-D Trees (for nearest neighbor search in ML/geometry)
* Bloom Filters (probabilistic data structure)
* LSM Trees (used in databases like Cassandra, LevelDB)

---

✅ This goes from **Arrays → Advanced Trees/Graphs → Specialized Structures** in increasing difficulty.

Would you like me to **make this into a dark-theme roadmap flowchart (like the previous ones)** so you can **visualize the learning path**?
